      <h1>Polar Bear</h1>
      <p>
        Polar bears are the largest land carnivores in the world, adapted to living in the Arctic Circle where they primarily hunt seals and other marine mammals. These bears have a thick layer of blubber and dense fur to protect them from the extreme cold, and their white fur helps them blend in with their icy environment. Polar bears are strong swimmers and can often be found roaming the sea ice, where they rely on their keen sense of smell to locate their prey. These bears are also excellent hunters and can go for weeks without eating when necessary. While polar bears are powerful predators, they are also vulnerable to climate change as the loss of sea ice threatens their habitat and food sources.</p>
