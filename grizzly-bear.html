      <h1>Grizzly Bear</h1>
      <p>
        The grizzly bear, also known as the North American brown bear, is a subspecies of brown bear that inhabits North America's western region. This powerful predator can weigh up to 700 pounds and has a distinct hump on its shoulders. The grizzly bear's fur is often grayish or blonde-tipped and can sometimes have a silvery sheen, but not all grizzlies have these characteristics. The grizzly bear is known for its strength, intelligence, and exceptional hunting skills, and they can be found in a variety of habitats including forests, mountains, and tundra. Despite their large size and fierce reputation, grizzly bears are typically solitary animals except during the mating season or when raising cubs.</p>
